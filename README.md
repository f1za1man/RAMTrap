# RAMTRAP

RAMTRAP is a simulation of a RAM-based malware attack written in C++ using OOP principles.  
It was developed for our cybersecurity coursework.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a harmless educational simulation. It does **not** perform any malicious operations on real systems.

## 🔐 Purpose
To demonstrate how a simulated malware might:
- Infect RAM
- Hide itself from detection
- Spread within the system memory
- Execute payloads after a condition is met

## 🛠️ Technologies
- C++ (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Header files and separate class definitions

## 📁 Structure
- `main.cpp` – Execution logic
- `functions.cpp` – Definitions for malware-like behavior
- `functions.h` – Header file for declarations

## 🚀 How to Run
Compile using g++:
```bash
g++ main.cpp functions.cpp -o ramtrap

./ramtrap
